 ✅ Example 1: When YOLO detects 3 people (N = 3)
   N = number of detected objects

3 = [x1, y1, x2, y2] → top-left + bottom-right coordinates
    
.xyxy tensor:
tensor([
    [120.5, 180.2, 300.8, 550.4],   # person 1
    [420.1, 160.7, 580.9, 500.2],   # person 2
    [800.0, 200.5, 950.3, 520.1]    # person 3
])

.xywh Format
[x_center, y_center, width, height]
tensor([
    [200.5, 300.5, 180.0, 350.0],   # object 1
    [580.0, 290.3, 160.2, 310.4],   # object 2
    [900.7, 320.1, 150.1, 290.5]    # object 3
])

What cls Represents

cls = class number (integer)
To know what object it is, YOLO uses the class dictionary:
results[0].names
Example:
{0: 'person', 1: 'bicycle', 2: 'car', 3: 'motorcycle', ...}
so,
| cls value | Means   |
| --------- | ------- |
| `0`       | person  |
| `1`       | bicycle |
| `2`       | car     |
| `16`      | dog     |
| `17`      | cat     |

What each Track object contains

Each track represents one person (or object) being followed over time.

A track typically contains:
track_id      → unique integer (for each person)
tlbr          → bounding box [top, left, bottom, right]
score         → confidence score
cls           → class (person, car, etc.)
state         → (active, lost, removed)
age           → how many frames the person has been tracked
time_since_update → how many frames since last detection
velocity      → Kalman Filter state
